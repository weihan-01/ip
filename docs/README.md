## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

**"Invalid input: Todo description cannot be empty."**
- Make sure to provide a description for your todo task
- Example: `todo read book` ‚úÖ, not just `todo` ‚ùå

**"Invalid input: Deadline format: deadline <description> /by <yyyy-MM-dd>"**
- Check that you're using the correct format with `/by`
- Example: `deadline assignment /by 2025-10-15` ‚úÖ

**"Invalid input: Event format: event <description> /from <start> /to <end>"**
- Ensure you include both `/from` and `/to` parts
- Example: `event meeting /from 2025-09-30 /to 2025-09-30` ‚úÖ

**"An unexpected error occurred while adding the task."**
- Check your date format (should be yyyy-MM-dd)
- Ensure all required parts are included in your command
